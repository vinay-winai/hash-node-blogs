Generators are special functions in JavaScript, marked by the `function*` syntax, that can pause and resume their execution. This superpower is made possible by the `yield` keyword. Unlike regular functions that run to completion or terminate with a `return`, generators produce a sequence of values on demand.

```javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
  let i = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield ++i;
  }
}
const iterator = numberGenerator();

console.log(iterator.next().value); // 1
console.log(iterator.next().value); // 2
console.log(iterator.next().value); // 3
// ... and so on
```

We can also pass a value to the location where the generator previously yielded. Thus enabling too and fro communication between the generator function and the code calling the function from elsewhere.

```javascript
function* someRandomFunction(){
 const num = 1
 const newNum = yield num
 yield 1 + newNum
 yield 6
}
const returnNextElement = someRandomFunction()
const element1 = returnNextElement.next().value // 1
const element2 = returnNextElement.next(2).value // 3
const element3 = returnNextElement.next() // { value: 6, done: false }
returnNextElement.next() // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

When we pass an argument during a function call, the passed value will be placed where the latest executed yield statement was present.

**How Generators Work (Under the Hood)**:  
Generators leverage the closure property of the function and store the snapshot of the function state when a yield statement is encountered. Thus, for the consecutive calls it remembers the previous statement it has executed and resumes from that point.

```javascript
function someRandomFunction(array){
 let i = 0
 const inner = {next :
     function(){
         const element = array[i]
         i++
         return element
      }
 }
 return inner
}
const returnNextElement = someRandomFunction([1,2,3])
const element1 = returnNextElement.next() // 1
const element2 = returnNextElement.next() // 2
```

This is not *technically* a generator `function*` since behaviour of `yield` is not implemented. But it beautifully mimics the behavior. It demonstrates how state (`i`) is managed to provide the next element in a sequence with each `next()` call.

### *Briefly -*

**Iterator**: Decouples the task of iteration of data structure from the processing of an item.

`yield`: The heart of a generator function. `yield` acts as a strategic pause point. It sends a value back to the caller and remembers its state to resume from the same point on the next `next()` call which is very advantageous in specific scenarios (some are listed below).

**Advantages and Use Cases:**  
**Infinite Series:** Creating sequences which adhere to iterator protocol.  
**Lazy Evaluation:** Defer calculations until needed, improving efficiency when working with large datasets.  
**Readable Pipelines:** Build data-processing steps in a chainable manner.  
**Cleaner Asynchronous Flows:** Generators, especially when combined with promises, can simplify asynchronous code patterns. Checkout the article below where I have implemented `async` with `function*` and promise.
