To achieve this, familiarity with promises and the workings of the js event loop/asynchronicity is necessary. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9lNaTQ6n9c) covers these topics well. Needless to say you should know about generator functions too.  
You can learn about generators in my [article here](https://blog.deviant.works/generator-in-javascript).

A simple js async function

```javascript
async function getStockAnalysis(){
 const data = await fetch('https://stocks.com/today/global/top100')
 console.log(data)
}
getStockAnalysis()
```

Now let's recreate this simple async/await program without using `async` and `await`. We can achieve this with the help of a [generator](https://blog.deviant.works/generator-in-javascript) and promise.

```javascript
function doWhenDataReceived (value){
 returnNextElement.next(value)
}
function* getStockAnalysis(){
 const data = yield fetch('https://stocks.com/today/global/top100')
 console.log(data)  // prints data
}
const returnNextElement = getStockAnalysis()
const futureData = returnNextElement.next() //promise object
futureData.value.then(doWhenDataReceived)
// waiting for promise resolution since end of EOF.
// if resolution is successful the line commented as prints data gets executed.
```

Here generator function is assigned to `returnNextElement`. When it is called in the next line with `.next()`, the `fetch` will return a promise object, the `futureData` will store the yielded value in this from `{value: Promise, done: false}` and the generater function `getStockAnalysis()` is paused now.

In the line `futureData.value.then(doWhenDataReceived)` we will assign `doWhenDataReceived` to Promise.then() i.e., microtask queue so that it will run after the promise resolves to success.  
If successful and microtask queue runs this, `doWhenDataReceived` will resume the `getStockAnalysis()` and pass the value fetched. Now finally `console.log(data)` gets executed.
